Hallo. Hi. Rojbaş. Merhaba.

My name is Berfin! I'm currently studying User Experience Design in my 1st semester of the Master's program at Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences (Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt). I discovered my passion for digital design as a teenager. I spent hours creating designs and implementing creative ideas - just because I loved it. I studied Computer Science and Design, a unique combination that perfectly matched my interests, and successfully completed my Bachelor's degree.

Now, I'm studying User Experience Design in my Master's program at Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences. I'm particularly fascinated by user-centered design: it's about creating digital experiences that really reach and inspire people - and that's the most exciting part of my work for me.

I love digging into the details, taking feedback and tweaking things until they are perfect. It always reminds me how much I love both disciplines: technology and design. When the code I write works, it feels like a magical moment - everything comes together seamlessly and ideas become reality. It's this mixture of creativity, precision and the joy of the result that motivates me every day.
