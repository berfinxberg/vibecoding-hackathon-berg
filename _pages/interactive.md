  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This thesis focuses on the user-centered design of a mobile application that strengthens self-care for women with diabetes. The goal was to create a digital companion that combines functional support with emotional resonance, beyond classic tracking logic and medical control. The focus was on self-care, empowerment, and everyday practicality. Based on qualitative research, core use cases, content, and interaction patterns were developed and iteratively translated into wireframes, a low-fidelity prototype, and a high-fidelity prototype. Particular attention was paid to tone and visual language, expressed through a fitting mascot and warm, illustrative design. The center is not the monitoring of numbers, but the person and her needs. Usability tests in both prototype phases provided important insights for further refinement. The final application combines functional clarity with empathetic guidance and creates space for self-reflection, exchange, and individual support in everyday life with diabetes.</p>
