excerpt: >-
  UNNIEQUE is my bachelor thesis project, developed as part of my studies in Computer Science & Design. The name combines the Korean word "Unnie" (&#50616;&#45768;) - meaning an older sister - with the English word "unique." The project explores how a mobile app can support young women with diabetes beyond medical tracking, by focusing on emotional well-being, self-care and everyday life.
